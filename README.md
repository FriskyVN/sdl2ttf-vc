# sdl2ttf-vc
> A slightly modified mirror of the [SDL_ttf Visual C++ development libraries](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/).

The include paths of the SDL library in the source code have been changed to remain compatible with [sdl2-vc](https://github.com/FriskyVN/sdl2-vc) and the other mirrored development libraries hosted on GitHub as git submodules.
